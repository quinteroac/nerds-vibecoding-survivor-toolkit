<!-- TODO: Complete. All content in English. -->

## Objective

Create or update `.agents/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` so it defines:

- **Conventions** — Project-wide agreements (naming, formatting, workflow).
- **Tech stack** — Languages, frameworks, and key dependencies.
- **Code standards** — Style, patterns, and quality expectations.
- **Testing strategy** — How tests are written, run, and maintained.
- **Product architecture** — High-level structure and main components.
- **Modular structure** — How the codebase is split into modules or packages.
- **Implemented capabilities** — Features and behaviour already in place (updated as the product evolves).


## Inputs

TBD — PR document, existing PROJECT_CONTEXT.md if any.

## Outputs

TBD — `.agents/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`. Cap 250 lines (see summary mechanism in process_design).

## Checklist

TBD — e.g. do not exceed 250 lines.
