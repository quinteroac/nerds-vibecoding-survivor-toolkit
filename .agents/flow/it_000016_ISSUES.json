    "description": "Test case TC-US001-04 resulted in status: failed.\nNotes: The 6 existing tests in approve-prototype.test.ts all pass (bun test exit code 0), but none exercise the pre-commit hook failure message format.\nEvidence: approve-prototype.ts:114-118 throws 'Failed to create prototype approval commit: ${commitResult.stderr || \"git commit command failed.\"}' on commit failure. FR-3 requires the error to be wrapped as 'Pre-commit hook failed:\\n<hook output>'. Implementation does not apply that prefix; no test covering this scenario exists in approve-prototype.test.ts.\nCorrelated requirements: US-001, FR-3",
