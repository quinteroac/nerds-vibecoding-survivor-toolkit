  "prompt": "# Execute Test Batch\n\nExecute all provided automated test cases from the approved test plan in a single session.\n\nAll generated content must be in English.\n\n## Inputs\n\nUse the provided context sections:\n- `project_context`: project conventions, runtime, quality checks, and constraints\n- `test_cases`: JSON array of test case objects, each with id, description, mode, and correlated requirements\n\n## Execution Rules\n\n1. Read all test cases in `test_cases` before running any commands.\n2. Follow constraints from `project_context` when selecting commands, environment setup, and verification steps.\n3. Execute each test case in order. Share session context (e.g. environment setup, installed dependencies) across test cases to avoid redundant work.\n4. Capture concise evidence from command outputs or observed results for each test case.\n5. Determine outcome per test case:\n   - `passed`: acceptance for this test case was satisfied\n   - `failed`: acceptance for this test case was not satisfied\n   - `skipped`: test case cannot be executed due to a justified blocker\n\n## Output Contract (Mandatory)\n\nReturn only a JSON array with one result object per test case, in the same order as the input. Each object must have this exact shape:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"testCaseId\": \"the test case id\",\n    \"status\": \"passed|failed|skipped\",\n    \"evidence\": \"string\",\n    \"notes\": \"string\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nEvery test case in the input must have a corresponding result in the output array.\n\nDo not output markdown or additional text outside the JSON array.\n\n\n---\n\n## Context\n\n### project_context\n\n# Project Context\n\n<!-- Created or updated by `bun nvst create project-context`. Cap: 250 lines. -->\n\n## Conventions\n- Naming: files use `kebab-case.ts`; exported command handlers use `camelCase` with `run` prefix (e.g. `runCreateProjectContext`); other exported helpers use standard `camelCase`; types/interfaces use `PascalCase`; Zod schemas use `PascalCaseSchema` (e.g. `StateSchema`); constants use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`\n- Formatting: no enforced formatter (no Prettier/ESLint config); rely on TypeScript strict mode for correctness\n- Git flow: trunk-based on `master`; conventional commit prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`)\n- Workflow: NVST manages iterations via `state.json`; all commands validate state before acting and persist transitions back\n\n## Tech Stack\n- Language: TypeScript (strict mode, ESNext target)\n- Runtime: Bun (v1+)\n- Frameworks: none — pure CLI application\n- Key libraries: `zod` (^3.23.8) for runtime schema validation; `typescript` (^5.6.3) for type checking only\n- Package manager: Bun (`bun.lock`)\n- Build / tooling: no build step; Bun runs `.ts` files directly; `tsconfig.json` used for type checking only (`outDir: \"dist\"` unused)\n\n## Code Standards\n- Style patterns: one file per CLI command in `src/commands/`; pure orchestration in `src/agent.ts`; pure state I/O in `src/state.ts`; argv parsing and routing in `src/cli.ts`\n- Error handling: commands throw `Error` with descriptive messages; `cli.ts` wraps in `try/catch` and sets `process.exitCode = 1` (never `process.exit()`); `schema.safeParse()` for validation (not `.parse()`)\n- Module organisation: `src/` for toolkit code; `scaffold/schemas/` for Zod schemas used by `state.ts` and `write-json`; `schemas/` for validation scripts/copies; `scaffold/` for project templates; `.agents/` for runtime agent state/skills/flow\n- Forbidden patterns: no `process.exit()` calls (use `process.exitCode`); no synchronous I/O; no third-party CLI frameworks (keep deps minimal)\n\n## Testing Strategy\n- Approach: initial unit tests for core modules; schema validation scripts and manual CLI verification for the rest\n- Runner: `bun:test` (Bun built-in)\n- Coverage targets: none defined yet\n- Test location convention: co-located `*.test.ts` files alongside source (e.g. `src/state.test.ts`)\n\n## Product Architecture\n- NVST is a CLI toolkit (`bun nvst <command>`) that orchestrates an iterative development workflow through three phases: Define → Prototype → Refactor\n- Commands delegate content generation to AI agents (Claude, Codex, Gemini) via `src/agent.ts` which loads skill prompts from `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`\n- Workflow state is tracked in `.agents/state.json` (validated by Zod schema); workflow-transition commands read/validate/update state, while utility commands (`init`, `destroy`, `write-json`) and `refine requirement` do not persist state\n- JSON file generation must be performed through `nvst write-json`; direct ad hoc JSON file creation is out of scope for the workflow\n- Iteration artifacts (PRDs, progress files, changelogs) live in `.agents/flow/` with `it_XXXXXX_` prefixes\n\n## Modular Structure\n- `src/cli.ts`: CLI router — parses argv and dispatches to command handlers\n- `src/agent.ts`: agent invocation — provider config, skill loading, prompt building, subprocess spawning\n- `src/state.ts`: state I/O — read/write/validate `.agents/state.json`\n- `src/commands/*.ts`: one handler per command (`create-project-context`, `approve-requirement`, etc.)\n- `scaffold/schemas/`: Zod schemas used by `state.ts` and `write-json` for runtime validation\n- `schemas/`: validation scripts/copies of scaffold schemas\n- `scaffold/`: project templates copied by `nvst init`\n- `.agents/skills/`: agent skill prompts (SKILL.md per skill)\n- `.agents/flow/`: iteration artifacts (PRDs, progress, changelogs)\n\n## Constraints\n- CLI-only: must remain a pure CLI tool, no web UI\n- Minimal dependencies: avoid adding third-party packages unless strictly necessary\n- Bun-native: use `Bun.spawn` for direct process spawning and `Bun.$` (shell tagged template) for shell pipelines; `Bun.write`/`Bun.file` for file copying; `node:fs/promises` and `node:path` are the primary file I/O layer\n\n## Implemented Capabilities\n<!-- Updated at the end of each iteration by bun nvst create project-context -->\n- `nvst init` / `nvst destroy`: scaffold and tear down project structure\n- `nvst start iteration`: begin a new iteration cycle\n- `nvst create project-context` / `refine project-context` / `approve project-context`: full project context definition and refinement flow\n- `nvst define requirement` / `refine requirement` / `approve requirement`: full requirement definition flow with interactive refinement and challenge mode\n- `nvst create prototype`: iterative agent-driven implementation of user stories with progress tracking, quality checks, and git automation\n- `nvst write-json`: schema-validated JSON generation from agent output\n- Agent invocation system: multi-provider support (Claude, Codex, Gemini) with skill-based prompt loading\n- State management: Zod-validated `state.json` with phase/status tracking\n\n\n### test_cases\n\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": \"TC-001\",\n    \"description\": \"Execute all pending automated tests in a single batch.\",\n    \"mode\": \"automated\",\n    \"correlatedRequirements\": [\n      \"US-001\",\n      \"FR-1\",\n      \"FR-2\",\n      \"FR-4\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"TC-002\",\n    \"description\": \"Handle partial results from the agent (e.g., 5 sent, 3 returned).\",\n    \"mode\": \"automated\",\n    \"correlatedRequirements\": [\n      \"US-001\",\n      \"FR-4\",\n      \"FR-6\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"TC-003\",\n    \"description\": \"Handle total agent failure (non-zero exit or invalid JSON).\",\n    \"mode\": \"automated\",\n    \"correlatedRequirements\": [\n      \"US-001\",\n      \"FR-5\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"TC-004\",\n    \"description\": \"Resume execution: Skip already passed automated tests.\",\n    \"mode\": \"automated\",\n    \"correlatedRequirements\": [\n      \"US-001\",\n      \"FR-8\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"TC-005\",\n    \"description\": \"Verify batch prompt structure.\",\n    \"mode\": \"automated\",\n    \"correlatedRequirements\": [\n      \"US-001\",\n      \"FR-3\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"TC-006\",\n    \"description\": \"Sequential presentation of manual tests.\",\n    \"mode\": \"automated\",\n    \"correlatedRequirements\": [\n      \"US-002\",\n      \"FR-1\",\n      \"FR-6\",\n      \"FR-7\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"TC-007\",\n    \"description\": \"User input validation (status, evidence, notes).\",\n    \"mode\": \"automated\",\n    \"correlatedRequirements\": [\n      \"US-002\",\n      \"FR-6\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"TC-008\",\n    \"description\": \"Resume execution: Skip passed manual tests.\",\n    \"mode\": \"automated\",\n    \"correlatedRequirements\": [\n      \"US-002\",\n      \"FR-8\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"TC-010\",\n    \"description\": \"Verify `execute-test-case` skill prompt update.\",\n    \"mode\": \"automated\",\n    \"correlatedRequirements\": [\n      \"US-003\",\n      \"FR-9\",\n      \"FR-3\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"TC-011\",\n    \"description\": \"Verify progress JSON integrity after batch execution.\",\n    \"mode\": \"automated\",\n    \"correlatedRequirements\": [\n      \"US-004\",\n      \"FR-8\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"TC-012\",\n    \"description\": \"Verify individual artifact generation.\",\n    \"mode\": \"automated\",\n    \"correlatedRequirements\": [\n      \"US-004\",\n      \"FR-8\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"TC-013\",\n    \"description\": \"Verify final report generation.\",\n    \"mode\": \"automated\",\n    \"correlatedRequirements\": [\n      \"US-004\",\n      \"FR-8\"\n    ]\n  }\n]\n",
